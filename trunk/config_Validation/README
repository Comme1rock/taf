All the config files in this directory are intended for validation of code developments. 
The main principle is that new developments should be compatible with the analysis of old 
data. In this spirit the validation procedure intent to verify that the new developments 
still allow to reproduce old results.

The set of config files in this directory are as well intented for learning how to use 
TAF to new users by analysing data of different nature and experimental setups.

The config files in this directory contain in the form of commentaries all the information 
needed to preform the validations, i.e. they contain,
  - The meaning of the config file, i.e. which kind of data it represents, e.g. beam-test, 
    radioactive source at laboratory, ...
  - The location of the data to be used.
  - The list of procedures to be run on this data.

Each config file, with a generic name runXXX.cfg, where XXX is a run number, has a similarly 
named pdf file (runXXX.pdf), which contains a list of plots issued from running the requested 
procedures. In the proccess of validation, the developper should compare the plots he/she produces 
during with the reference plots and numbers in the runXXX.pdf file.

In order to be able to use the config files in the config_Validation directory you will need to create 
a symbolic link inside the config directory, e.g.

>$ cd config/
>$ ln -s ../config_Validation/runXXX.cfg .

An additional steps will be to verify that the DataPath: variable in the config file 
is point to a location reacheable by your system.

You are now ready to start the validation process just by reading out the executing TAF and 
reading out the config file,

>$ taf -run XXX

And then executing the procedures stated as commentary at the beginning of the config file.

Here below is a list with a quick description of the set of config files for the validation/learning 
procedure. Even though the validation procedure mandatory requires that some of the config files 
listed below to be fully executed, some others are optional depending of the kind of developments 
being carried out. This is why each config file below has additional information about when it should 
be executed.

//1st list the mandatory ones, and then try to classify them according to which developments should be 
//require additional validations.

    NOTE:    Not able to correctly read data. Spotted a couple of changes in DPlane for Readout == 232, and some changes inside IMGBoardReader. Need to check with Jerome hoe to fix this.
             This data corresponds to multi-frame data-taking with a beta (Sr-90) source. Need to implement in MRaw a procedure to 
             anayse this data. Need to tranlate a private code into taf. Will be useful for beta source data in PIPPER-2 sensor.
